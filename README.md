# Greypingar-MSL-generator
This is a processor of user scores collected according to the method described in "Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity" by VuliÄ‡ et al.

The processor takes in scorelists from all participants, finds Pilehvar outliers, then creates both the APIAA and AMIAA scores (ordered by parts-of-speech), and outputs final data based on filtered scorelists.
